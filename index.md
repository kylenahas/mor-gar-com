As I opened the creaky rolling door, a shaft of light penetrated the dusty, cobweb filled garage for the first time in decades. Amongst the abandoned family heirlooms, a neglected creature beckoned to me. As I approached, I saw a stark reflection of myself, my soul, man, transposed across the machine. It had an allure I had not felt in years.

I brushed away some of the dust and flicked the power switch. No visible signs of life. Determined, I searched for it's plug. With my back to the machine, bent over, and no outlet in sight, I heard him speak for the first time... a booming, "**MORGAR BEAT GORGAR**".  Odd. I hadn't plugged him in. 

"I see you found the pinball machine", the property owner startled me. "My father was obsessed with that thing. He'd spend hours in there, just staring at it, working on it, losing all sense of time and reality." I turned back to the game. Trying to contain my excitement, I blurted out "How much would you sell it for?" The tired lady sighed, "I'm afraid Gorgar is not for sale." Dejected, but determined, I continued to pursue the bounty. She replied, "It would be bad luck to sell something cursed..." Her partner came around the corner, "Honey, maybe we could work out a deal, trade Gorgar for his help getting all this junk out of here?" We shook on the deal. Little did I know what I was getting myself into. 

I welcomed Gorgar into my home. Sure, it took a bit of rethinking the interior design, but he was worth it. As I plugged him in, there it was again: "**MORGAR BEAT GORGAR**". Who's Morgar? I scrounged up some quarters from the couch cushions, and deposited three into the right coin slot. As I pressed start, the game came to life, and I was introduced to Morgar. The spirit of Morgar had possessed the demonly Gorgar. Morgar was the reason I had found this game carnally magnetic. He spoke- "MORGAR SPEAKS!"

The game played differently then I remember.... It was much more complex than I remember playing in arcades, much more complex than it should have been for 1979, when Gorgar first spoke to the masses. Had the previous owner made some improvements? There was a ball save, skill shot, tons of new modes and features! Could this game really have been possessed by Morgar? Come play and find out!
